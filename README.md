# Gender-and-Age-Detection-OpenCV-Python-With-Source-Code
The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final softmax layer).


we implemented a CNN to detect gender and age from a single picture of a face.
